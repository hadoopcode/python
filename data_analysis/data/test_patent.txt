AB    NOVELTY - The method involves establishing a deep belief network prediction model of a four-layer network structure. The actual power consumption of the measured power load is combined to train the deep belief network prediction model using an unsupervised greedy algorithm. The parameter values of each layer of the deep belief network prediction model are obtained and the activation function of the deep belief network prediction model is set. The mapping relationship between the input and output of the deep belief network prediction model is obtained through training and learning. The actual power consumption of the measured power load is predicted and the predicted power consumption of the measured power load is obtained according to the determined depth belief network prediction model.
   USE - Short-term power load prediction method of power system.
   ADVANTAGE - The depth belief network prediction network is introduced into the power load power prediction, and the internal relationship between the input and the output is learned to realize a prediction of the load power consumption for the period of time through the deep structure of the network. The short-term power load prediction process largely predicts the accuracy and speed of prediction and is created to predict the short-term power load conditions.

AB    NOVELTY - The method involves sampling user information collected in a base station. The user number, access time, and user location information of accessing the base station are recorded. The user data collected by the base station is collated and merged into path data that can be trained by the model, and data samples of all users are combined to obtain a sample set that is ultimately used for training. A neural network model is constructed to select a fully connected neural network as the training model. The average square error is used to calculate the training error. The commonly used forward propagation method is used to obtain a training result during training. The reverse propagation method is used to update the parameters in the neural network. The real value of the predicted coordinate in the sample error is calculated by using the actual coordinate and the predicted coordinate. The data to be predicted is collected and the position of the user is predicted at the next time.
   USE - Small base station switch control method based on deep neural network.
   ADVANTAGE - The accuracy of prediction and the practicality of system can be improved.
